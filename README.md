**Title of the manuscript:** Keeping up with the heat: Long-term dynamics and plasticity of heat tolerance in a tropical plant community
**Authors:** Georgia G. Hernández, Martijn Slot, Lucas da Cunha Godoy, Raquel Castro, Alejandra Pérez-Enríquez, Jeffrey R. Seemann, Carlos García-Robledo

**Description:** This repository contains the data and R code associated with the manuscript investigating the inter-annual dynamics of photosynthetic heat tolerance (T50​).
This was done in a tropical Zingiberales community at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. 

The analysis tracks the heat tolerance of 35 species over a seven-year period (2017–2023). 
The primary focus is understanding whether tropical plants can acclimate to year-to-year temperature fluctuations and identifying physiological trade-offs between baseline tolerance and thermal plasticity.

-------------------
**Research Questions:**
1. Does heat tolerance of the Zingiberales community vary across years?
2. Do species differ in their inter-annual plasticity, and does this difference alter their relative heat tolerance rankings from year to year?
3. How does heat tolerance vary from year to year in response to local temperature changes?
